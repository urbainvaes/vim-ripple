OVERVIEW                                                               *ripple*

Ripple is a tool to seamlessly send code chunks to an interactive language
shell, or read-eval-print loop (REPL).

USAGE                                                            *ripple-usage*

Ripple aims to provide vim users with the ability to easily send code chunks
to a language shell. This can prove very useful for quickly testing a subset
of a script, or for running a script bit by bit without a debugger.

COMMANDS                                                      *ripple-commands*

                                                               *ripple-:Ripple*
:[range] Ripple [text]
    If the argument [text] is specified, send it to the REPL. Else, if the
    command is called with a [range], send the corresponding line range in
    the current buffer to the REPL.

    It can be convenient to combine this command with a mapping, e.g. >
        nnoremap yrc :Ripple clear<cr>

MAPPINGS                                                      *ripple-mappings*

Global~

The <Plug> mappings are always defined, but the mappings to physical keys are
enabled only if |g:ripple_enable_mappings| is set to `1`.

<Plug>(ripple_open_repl), |y<cr>|
    Open the REPL window (Normal mode mapping).
    Mnemonic: "you enter (the REPL)"

<Plug>(ripple_send_motion), |yr|
    Send text object to the REPL window (Normal mode mapping).
    Mnemonic: "you run".

<Plug>(ripple_send_selection), |R|
    Send text object to the REPL window (Visual mode mapping).
    Mnemonic: "run".

<Plug>(ripple_send_previous), |yp|
    Resend the latest selection sent to the REPL. More precisely, send the
    code that is currently at the location of the latest code chunk sent to
    the REPL. If the contents of the buffer changed in the meantime, this code
    might be different from the latest code chunk.

<Plug>(ripple_send_buffer), |y<cr>|
    Send the whole buffer to the REPL.

<Plug>(ripple_send_line), |yrr|
    Send the current line to the REPL. This is equivalent to >
        <Plug>(ripple_send_motion)_

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                   *ripple-config*

Global configuration~

*g:ripple_repls*
    Dictionary for user-defined REPLs. For buffer-local repl definitions, see
    |b:ripple_repl| below.

    Internally, a REPL configuration for a given filetype is a combination of
    four variables:
          - A {command} to start the REPL;
          - A pair of strings {string1} and {string2} to prepend and append to
            code sent to the REPL, respectively. This is sometimes necessary
            to enable sending several lines of code to the REPL at once.
          - A boolean {extra_cr} that controls whether an additional <cr>
            should be appended to the code chunks that are followed by a blank
            line. (This can be useful to avoid the need to press <cr> manually
            in the terminal window. In ipython, for example, two <cr> are
            required to run an indented block.)

    In the dictionary |g:ripple_repl|, the keys are |filetype|s and the values
    are either of the following:
        - A string containing the {command} to start the REPL (e.g. 'bash',
          'guile'). In this case the other parameters are assumed to be as
          follows: {string1} = "",  {string2} = "" and {extra_cr} = 0.
        - A list of with four entries:
              [{command}, {string1}, {string2}, {extra_cr}]

    Default: >
       {  "python": ["ipython", "\<c-u>\<esc>[200~", "\<esc>[201~", 1],
        \ "julia": "julia",
        \ "lua": "lua",
        \ "r": "R",
        \ "ruby": "irb",
        \ "scheme": "guile",
        \ "sh": "bash",
        \ "zsh": "zsh"}

*g:ripple_winpos*
    Modifier for the window position. In nvim, this modifier is prepended to
    the |new| command when opening the terminal window. In vim, it is
    prepended to the |term| command.
    Default: 'vertical'.

*g:ripple_enable_mappings*
    Set this to 0 to disable all mappings apart from the <plug> mappings.
    Default: 1.

*g:ripple_highlight*
    Highlight group employed to highlight text objects sent to the REPL.
    Default: '|DiffAdd|'.

*g:ripple_term_name*
    Name of the REPL buffer.

*g:ripple_term_options* (vim only)
    Dictionary with additional options to pass to `term_start()`.

Buffer-local configuration~

*b:ripple_repl*
    REPL configuration for current buffer. This takes precedence over
    the global option `g:ripple_repls[&filetype]`.

*b:ripple_term_name*
    Name of the REPL buffer. This takes precedence over
    the global option `g:ripple_term_name`.
